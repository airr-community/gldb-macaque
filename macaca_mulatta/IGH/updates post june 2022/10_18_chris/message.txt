Hi Corey, Wiliam, and Martin, 

Yes, I have the results from running the new version of IgDiscover on the datasets from Vazquez Bernat et al.

The attached fasta file has all of the newly inferred alleles from that run. I am not sure the best way to compare my results with what Martin got. 

Martin, is there additional data you need for the comparison?

Yes, I have the IGL and IGK databases to introduce and discuss. 

Best,
Chris

Hey Martin and Chris, 

I hope you are both well. William and I were just discussing agenda items for tomorrow monkey GLDB call.
 
Wanted to check in with you both that you are 1) able to attend, and 2) willing to share any updates you have (Martin/Chris: update on IgDiscover IGHV results; & Chris: new data on IGKV, IGLV data). If you have a sec to confirm with us, would be great! Just want to avoid throwing you in front of the bus, if you arenâ€™t readyðŸ˜Š
 
THANKS!
Corey and William
