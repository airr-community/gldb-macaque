comparing 07_25_chris with 06_13_william:

notes from Mats and Martin:

-----------------
3UBQ
B3XO
XGQN
RTK4
MATZ
These are the 3-100 allelic variants that have the leader issue in KIMDB version 1 but are resolved in version 2, so I think these are most of the ones on your list, Mats.
We should check the other two also, thanks for pointing those out.

Hi!

I don't know if you already fixed this but a couple of genes that were in the file that was circulated by mail in May seems to carry a few bases from the leader sequences. These are IGHV-CDB4, IGHV-DCTO, IGHV-YXFU, IGHV-B3XO, IGHV-MATZ, IGHV-XGQN, IGHV-3UBQ, IGHV-RTK4. If already addressed, just ignore this message.
---------------------

the following fixed by kimdb updates:
seq_id	match	matched_label
IGHV3-100*01	query_is_existing_sub	3UBQ
IGHV3-100*01_S2822	query_is_new_sub	B3XO
IGHV3-100*01_S4205	query_is_existing_sub	XGQN
IGHV3-100*01_S4375	query_is_existing_sub	RTK4
IGHV3-100*02_S9884	query_is_new_sub	MATZ



CDB4 is kimdb IGHV3-100*02_S9884 with additional GGTG at 5' and AG at 3'. Now marked as don't include in rhesus_consolidated, with a comment in notes

DCTO is  IMGT IGHV3-132*01_a39c_g164c_t309c with additional leader at 5'. no kimdb v1.1 match. 
added subsequence without leader to db and rhesus_consolidated

YXFU was in corey's paper and is IMGT IGHV3-18*02 (not in kimdb) - this was one of the Ps brought in from IMGT
also in 3.185, but it is non-functional. mark as such. 3-18*01 also annotated by digger as non-functional donor splice.
