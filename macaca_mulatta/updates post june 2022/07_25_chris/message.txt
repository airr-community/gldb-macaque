Hi All, 

Attached is an updated VH database with the error corrections identified by Mats and Martin and additional curation notes. Only entries with "include_in_set‚Äù = Y should be in the final database.  

A summary of the results for IgDiscover with inference is also attached.

Of the 137 new VH genes/alleles that were detected in more than one dataset, 45 were confidently detected in more than one animal.
Of those 45, 12 were 3-prime variants and were not included in final database, 1 was identical to a corrected version of IGHV-D56D (duplicate was dropped from final database), and 6 were identical to entries from the KIMDB macaca fascicularis DB (included in final database).

The 992 new VH genes/alleles were detected in only one dataset were probably false positives due in some degree to issue Martin noted in the readme Google doc. Should those be investigated further?  

Let me know if there are any questions.

Best,
Chris
