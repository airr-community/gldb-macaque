3UBQ
B3XO
XGQN
RTK4
MATZ
These are the 3-100 allelic variants that have the leader issue in KIMDB version 1 but are resolved in version 2, so I think these are most of the ones on your list, Mats.
We should check the other two also, thanks for pointing those out.

Hi!

I don't know if you already fixed this but a couple of genes that were in the file that was circulated by mail in May seems to carry a few bases from the leader sequences. These are IGHV-CDB4, IGHV-DCTO, IGHV-YXFU, IGHV-B3XO, IGHV-MATZ, IGHV-XGQN, IGHV-3UBQ, IGHV-RTK4. If already addressed, just ignore this message.


Best wishes,

Mats

Hello All,

Attached are the updated rhesus_consolidated database and an updated summary slide after adding the additional 75 datasets from Zhang et al 2019. 

total_VDJs = number of times that gene/allele was detected across all the datasets
dataset_count = number of datasets a gene/allele was detected in

There are 56 genes/alleles that have no expression data. This decreased slightly from the 64 genes/alleles that were lacking expression data before adding the 75 datasets from Zhang et al 2019 indicating that as more data is added some of these may turn out to be functional. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
